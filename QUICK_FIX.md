# Quick Fix Summary 🎯

## The Problem
Your Vercel frontend is trying to connect to `localhost:5000` instead of your Render backend.

## The Solution (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Vercel ⚙️

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **stock-verse** project
3. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these two variables:

```
Variable 1:
Name:  VITE_API_URL
Value: https://stock-verse.onrender.com
Environment: ✓ Production

Variable 2:
Name:  VITE_ASSISTANT_URL
Value: https://stock-verse-1.onrender.com
Environment: ✓ Production
```

5. Click **Save** for each one

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel 🚀

**Option A - Automatic (Easiest):**
- Vercel should automatically redeploy when it detects the git push
- Go to **Deployments** tab and wait for it to finish

**Option B - Manual:**
- Go to **Deployments** tab
- Click on latest deployment → **⋯** menu → **Redeploy**

### Step 3: Verify It Works ✅

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Visit: https://stock-verse-nine.vercel.app
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. You should see:
   - ✅ `GET https://stock-verse.onrender.com/...` (200 OK)
   - ❌ NOT: `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/...` (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)

## What Was Changed in Your Code

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `src/components/StockChart.tsx` - Now uses env variable
- ✅ `src/components/RandomGraph.tsx` - Now uses env variable
- ✅ `backend/server.py` - Fixed proxy endpoint

### Already Deployed:
- ✅ Render backend - Already redeployed and running
- ⏳ Vercel frontend - Waiting for you to add environment variables

## Quick Test After Setup

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Should return data from Render, not connection error
fetch('https://stock-verse.onrender.com/test')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

## Estimated Time
- Adding variables: **2 minutes**
- Redeployment: **2-3 minutes**
- **Total: ~5 minutes** ⏱️
